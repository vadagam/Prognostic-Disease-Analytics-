Prognostic Disease Analytics is a burgeoning field that amalgamates healthcare and data analytics,
offering a transformative approach to predicting and managing diseases. This abstract provides an
overview of a user-friendly application incorporating Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive
Bayes, and k-nearest Neighbour algorithms for prognostic disease prediction. The application,
built using Python's Tkinter library, allows users to input patient symptoms and leverages four
distinct machine-learning models for disease prediction. A variety of symptoms matched to distinct
diseases make up the training and testing dataset. It helps with a better understanding and
interpretation of the results by enabling users to investigate the relationship between diseases and
symptoms. The application incorporates a database to store patient data and forecasts, ensuring
data traceability and facilitating future study. To sum up, this abstract highlights how models may
be included into an intuitive user interface and highlights how these applications might advance
predictive disease analytics for better healthcare outcomes.

Objectives:
• The model allows users to input symptoms and the system predicts the disease.
• Quick assessment and therapy are made possible by prompt identification, which may
enhance results and lessen the severity of the illness.
• This can lead to better resource management, cost savings, and improved overall healthcare
system performance.
• This adaptability ensures that the models stay current with evolving medical knowledge
and patient demographics.
